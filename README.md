# tweet_sentiment_analysis
The goal of this project is to build and critically analyse supervised Machine Learning methods, to predict the 
sentiment of Tweets. That is, given a tweet, the models will produce a prediction of the sentiment that is 
present in the tweet. The data set of tweets that have been annotated with positive, 
negative, and neutral sentiments.


The goal of this project is to critically assess the effectiveness of various Machine Learning classification 
algorithms on the problem of determining a tweet's sentiment.
